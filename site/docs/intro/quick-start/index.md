Letâ€™s look at an example of how you can use Polyaxon for running deep learning experiments.

## Deploy local cluster

This example assumes a functional [Polyaxon Deployment](/docs/setup/).
If you have Polyaxon already deployed and running, you can skip this section and proceed to [create a project](/docs/intro/quick-start/#create-a-project).
Otherwise, this section will help you deploy a local Polyaxon cluster with default values.

> **Note**: Minikube is not meant to be a production environment.

Before you can deploy Polyaxon, make sure you have the following:
 * [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) installed and running.
 * [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
 * [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
 * [Polyaxon CLI](/docs/setup/cli/).

Add Polyaxon charts repo:

```bash
helm repo add polyaxon https://charts.polyaxon.com
```

Deploy Polyaxon with default config values on Minikube:

```bash
polyaxon admin deploy -t minikube
```

Wait for all deployments to be ready:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n polyaxon -w
```

Expose Polyaxon UI on your localhost:

```bash
polyaxon port-forward -t minikube
```

> **Tip**: You can learn more about how to customize your Polyaxon Deployment in the [setup section](/docs/setup/).

## Create a project

You can create a project using [Polyaxon UI](/docs/management/ui/projects/) or with [Polyaxon CLI](/docs/core/cli/project/#project-create)

This example uses a [public Github repo](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-quick-start)
for hosting the project and the Polyaxonfile manifests, similar results can be achieved using a local folder or other platforms, e.g. GitLab, Bitbucket, ...

## Start an experiment

Let's run a first experiment

```bash
$ polyaxon run --url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-quick-start/master/experimentation/simple.yml -l
```

> For more details about this command please run `polyaxon run --help`,
or check the [command reference](/docs/core/cli/run/)

The `-l` flag indicates that we want to stream the logs after starting the experiment.


## Start a Tensorboard

Let's start a tensorboard to see the results:

```bash
$ polyaxon run --hub tensorboard:single-run -P uuid=UUID -w
```

![run-dashboards](../../../../content/images/dashboard/runs/dashboards-tensorboard.png)

## Let's check the results on the dashboard as well

```bash
$ polyaxon dashboard -y
```

> For more details about this command please run `polyaxon dashboard --help`,
or check the [command reference](/docs/core/cli/dashboard/)

We can see that Polyaxon has logged some information automatically about our run:


![run-dashboards-many](../../../../content/images/dashboard/runs/dashboards-many.png)

Please check the [runs dashboard](/docs/management/runs-dashboard/) and the
[visualization section](/docs/experimentation/visualizations/) for more details.

## Congratulations

You've trained your first experiments with Polyaxon, visualized the results in Tensorboard and tracked metrics, with two commands.

Behind the scene a couple of things have happened:

 * You synced your GitHub project and used the last commit.
 * You ran a container with a custom image and command to train a model.
 * You persisted your logs and outputs.
 * You visualized the results using Polyaxon's native dashboard and Tensorboard.

To gain a deeper understanding of what happened and how Polyaxon can help you iterate faster with your experimentation,
please check the next section of [this tutorial](/docs/intro/quick-start/components/)
