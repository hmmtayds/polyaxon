## Overview

Polyaxon mapping is an automation tool to apply a list of parameters combination to a component sequentially or in parallel following a concurrency.

When a mapping is defined a pipeline is created to watch generated executions and manage their lifecycle and concurrency.
Because the mapping generates a pipeline, the [pipeline helpers](/docs/automation/helpers/) can be used for managing concurrency, early stopping, caching, ...

 * [Mapping specification](/docs/automation/mapping/specification/) for more details
 * [Pipeline Helpers](/docs/automation/helpers/) for more information about the helpers that can be used with mapping


## Use cases

Polyaxon Mapping can be used to:
 * Run a component in parallel using a user defined list of parameters
 * Train a machine learning model using an external optimization and suggestion service
 * Leverage a map/reduce style pattern
