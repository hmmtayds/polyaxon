## Overview

Polyaxon allows to resume, restart, and restart with copy mode previous operation runs with or without modification of the original manifest.

## Resuming operation

Polyaxon provides the possibility to resume an already stopped operation (experiment, job, or a service).

```bash
polyaxon ops resume
```

The way Polyaxon resumes operations is by automatically loading all artifacts generated by the previous and by using similar configuration that was used for scheduling the original operation.  

Users can also resume an operation with an updated environment or parameters by providing a preset(s). The CLI, Client, and UI provide a way to pass presets to submit with the resume API call.

```bash
polyaxon ops resume -f preset1.yaml -f preset2.yaml
```

> If you use an operation for training a machine learning or deep learning model, your code must have the logic to handle check-pointing and resuming the training.

## Restarting operation

Sometimes resuming is not option or you want to preserve the original operation run record immutable. 
In that case restarting an operation is a better option, Polyaxon by default will restart the operation with the same configuration: 

```bash
polyaxon ops restart
```

Users can also restart an operation with an updated environment or parameters by providing a preset(s). The CLI, Client, and UI provide a way to pass presets to submit with the restart API call.

```bash
polyaxon ops restart -f preset1.yaml -f preset2.yaml
```

## Restarting operation with copy mode

In order to restart an operation and automatically load the artifacts generated by the original operation run, users can enable the copy mode:

```bash
polyaxon ops restart --copy
```

The copy mode works as well with presets and can be enabled by the CLI, Client, and UI:

```bash
polyaxon ops restart -f preset1.yaml -f preset2.yaml --copy
```
