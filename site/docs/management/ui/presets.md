Scheduling presets is a feature for injecting certain information into operations at compilation time to preset configuration for node scheduling,
queue routing, resources requirements and definition, connections, and access level control.

Polyaxon allows to save these presets as Polyaxonfiles, and to use them interactively using Polyaxon CLI. 
Sometimes, some of these presets are generic and can be used in all projects, or you want to configure default 
manifests to be applied to all operations started by a user or in a specific project. 
You can save presets in your organization, and allow users to use them in their Polyaxonfiles.
